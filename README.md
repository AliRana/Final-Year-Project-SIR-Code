This is a repo for my Final Year Project where I create an SIR model along with its variants SIRV, SEIR and SIRD. This is coursework for my Computer Science Bsc at Aston University.

The main programs that should be run:

SIR_Final
SIRD_Model
SIRV_Model
SIER_Model

Optional (More experimental/In Development):
SEIR_Peak

Requires: 
numpy
scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
matplotlib.pyplo
